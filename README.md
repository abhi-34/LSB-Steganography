# LSB-Steganography
This project offers an LSB Steganography tool for hiding and extracting text within digital images. It subtly embeds secret messages into image pixel data, imperceptible to the eye. Users can hide text in a cover image or retrieve it from a stego-image, all via an interactive interface in Google Colab.
